# Discover one of the earliest programming languages and what it has to offer
What is C?  
Why do I need to learn about the 3rd letter of the alphabet!? Is something that you’re probably thinking about right now.

C is a low-level language.

It didn’t use to be. Back in the day when people carved punch cards out of granite, C was an incredible way to be free of the drudgery of lower-level languages like [assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language).

But now in these modern times, current-generation languages offer all kinds of features that didn’t exist in 1972 when C was invented. This means C is a pretty basic language with not a lot of features. It can do _anything_, but it can make you work for it.

So why would we even use it today?

As a learning tool: not only is C a venerable piece of computing history, but it is connected to the [bare metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bare_machine) in a way that present-day languages are not. When you learn C, you learn about how software interfaces with computer memory at a low level. There are no seatbelts. You’ll write software that crashes, I assure you. And that’s all part of the fun!

As a useful tool: C still is used for certain applications, such as building [operating systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) or in [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system)). (Though the [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) programming language is eyeing both these fields!)

This is the canonical example of a C program. Everyone uses it. 
```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)

{

printf("Hello, World!\n"); 

}
```
  
## PreRequisites

  
###  Visual Studio Code and MinGW  
  
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight code editor and MinGW is a software development environment that allows C/C++ to run. You can install both of them via this link, give it a read:

> "**[Click here to install both](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw#_prerequisites)**"

## How to Learn
You can either follow a **DOCS** approach or a **video lecture** approach, personally I shall recommend the **DOCS** approach because that’s more efficient and if you choose to pursue *CS/SDE* as a career path. Still pick whatever approach you want, who am I to judge :p.

  
## Learning Resources:

### DOCS approach (Recommended)

If you’d like to learn C in-depth you can check out this book:  
"**[Beej's Guide to C Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgc/pdf/bgc_usl_c_1.pdf)**"  
  
Else you can check one of these:  
  
"**[LearnC](https://www.learn-c.org/)**"  
 

"**[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/c/)**"  
  
  
I’d recommend picking up either one of these three and sticking to it till you learn the basics of the language.  
  
For those who only want to learn for college, learning till “pointers” is usually enough to score well in your exams.  
  
Else you can go as in depth as you want.  
  
## Video Lectures Approach  
### CS50x(Highly recommended)
  
Not only will you get a free certificate from Harvard and edx for completing this, you’ll also learn a lot more things than just C.  
"**[Click here to join CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/  )**"
  
### BroCode(Time effective)  
"**[Click here for BroCode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87SH2Cn0s9A&t=1186s)** "
  
### NesoAcademy (Indepth and easy to follow)  
"**[Click here for NesoAcademy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLf3jnHxSmU&list=PLBlnK6fEyqRggZZgYpPMUxdY1CYkZtARR)**"
  
  
Personally I’d recommend **CS50x** because as a CS student only knowing C isn’t enough, but if you’d like to learn at a more relaxed pace you can learn through the *other* two resources.  
  
## Ok I’ve learned the language what now?  
  
I’d recommend creating an account in CodeChef,Hackerrank or Leetcode and practicing there.  
For beginners I’d recommend Codechef as their problems are on the easier side.  
  
### CodeChef  
Create an account on "**[CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/)**"
Go serially through this sheet and try to solve atleast one problem daily for 30 days to create a habit.  
Regular practice will make everything a breeze.  
Solve coding challenges on platforms like CodeChef to apply your knowledge and enhance your problem-solving skills.

**"[Codechef practice Set](https://www.codechef.com/practice/logical-problems)"**

### Hackerrank  
After you're comfortable with Codechef you can try to get a 5 star rating in C at Hackerrank.

**"[Hackerrank C](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/c)"**  

  
There are other platforms *like leetcode codeforces and codingninjas*, you can explore and find the one you like.  
  
## I want to visually see what I’ve learnt!  
Then I recommend creating some projects.

### Web Development
1. Frontend Development
This involves creating the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) of a website or web application. Front-end developers use languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the visual elements of a site and make it interactive.
2. Backend Development
Back-end development involves building the server-side of a website or web application. Back-end developers work with languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or Node.js to handle server logic, database interactions, and other server-side operations.
3. Fullstack Development
 Full-stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development. They have the skills to work on all aspects of web development, from designing the UI/UX to implementing server logic and managing databases.
### Data Scientist
A data scientist is a professional who analyzes and interprets complex data to inform decision-making processes within an organization. They use a combination of statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and domain knowledge to extract insights from large datasets.
### AI/ML Developer
  AI/ML development involves creating and implementing algorithms and systems that enable computers to learn from data and perform tasks without explicit programming. This work encompasses designing, training, and optimizing machine learning models to solve various problems, from image recognition and natural language processing to recommendation systems and autonomous vehicles. AI/ML developers work with large datasets, experimenting with different algorithms and techniques to improve model performance and accuracy.
